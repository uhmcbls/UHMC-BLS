            <p>
                I've been lucky enough to call Maui home for a little over five years and
                currently serve as the Manager of Administrative Operations at Trilogy Excursions.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not making sure our crews and behind-the-scenes operations are running
                smoothly, you can find me outdoors soaking up the sunshine or exploring Maui’s
                back roads. My partner and I are also gearing up to start our own business.

            <h2>Yukai Sawada</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently studying business at UHMC. My career goal is to become an
                entrepreneur and start my own company in the future.
                <br><br>
                I love learning about finance and marketing, and I enjoy working with people who
                share creative ideas. In my free time, I like going to the gym and exploring
                new hobbies.
            </p>

            <h2>Jonas Marcial</h2>
            <p>
                I'm majoring in ABIT and focusing on the technology side of it. I currently work
                as a porter for Hawaiian Airlines. My goal is to find a job in IT, then focus on my hobbies:
                going to the gym, playing piano, and cooking.
                <br><br>
                I plan to move to the mainland after I graduate because I like the vibe there right now,
                but Maui will always be home.
