          <h1>What can Business Leaders Society do to help in the near future?</h1>
          <br>
          <h2>Campus Clean-Up & Recycling Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Overview:<br> 
            UHMC students will work together once a month to clean the campus 
            and nearby beach areas. The goal is to reduce waste, promote recycling, 
            and raise awareness about environmental protection<br>

            <br>
            Maui is known for its natural beauty, but litter and plastic waste 
            are growing problems. By organizing monthly clean-up events, we not 
            only protect the environment but also inspire others to take part in 
            sustainability efforts. Students can also turn this into a friendly 
            competition between departments — whoever collects the most recyclables
            wins a small prize!<br>

            <br>
            The goal is to make UHMC a cleaner and greener campus while encouraging students to 
            take responsibility for their community.
          </p>

          <br><br>
          <h2>Local Business Pop-Up Fair</h2>
          <p> 
            Overview:<br>
            Invite small local business owners, food vendors, and UHMC student 
            entrepreneurs to showcase their products and share their business stories 
            on campus.<br><br>

            Many local businesses in Maui struggle to gain exposure. 
            Hosting a Pop-Up Fair gives them a chance to connect with students, 
            sell products, and inspire future entrepreneurs. This event would also 
            let students practice real-world business and marketing skills — 
            from event planning to communication.<br>

            <br>
            The goal is to support Maui's local economy, encourage entrepreneurship, and 
            strengthen relationships between students and the community.
